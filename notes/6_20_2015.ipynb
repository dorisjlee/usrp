    "    - set up constant purely azimutal $A_\\phi = \\rho^2/\\beta_0$\n",
    "- since using MHD, higher Alfven speed causes the CFL condition to enforce a smaller time step, so the computational cost is greater, therefore the chosen domain is smaller than when ran in the hydro case (SPB)\n",

    "\n",
    "##4,5. Discussion & Conclusion\n",
    "- $\\dot{M}_{acc}$ is small again but this is due to MRI and not convective eddies as in the hydro case\n",
    "- in MHD you can't really look at what happen when you tweak the magnitude of the stress because there isnt really a $\\alpha$ to tweak, it is just something that pops out of the dynamics.\n",
    "- In addition to MRI, global magnetic stresses can also result in OLT and accretion and produce unbound outflow \n",
    "- Near the event horizon, Infall occurs much farther away ($6R_G$)from the last stable orbit since the high P from accretion is resisting infall \n",
    "- at within $3R_G$, the potential is so strong that the poloidal $B_r$ field is bent into a $B_\\phi$, causing the r-$\\phi$ component of the stress to increase by alot\n",
    "- for the axissymmetric case, you start of with flux=0 but as stuff gets accreted inwards more B lines are close together and B flux increase.With axissymmtry you can have dynamo effect that amplifies the B field\n",
    "- accretion flow is highly time-dependent and density and stress has extremely large fluctuations . \n",
    "- flow structure looks really different from hydro case \n",
    "Limitations: \n",
    "    - $\\because$ 2D axisymmtry --> no nonaxissymetric MRI modes\n",
    "    - dynamo can not be sustained\n",
