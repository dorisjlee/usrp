    "- Motivation: Linear stability analysis (general or onparticular type of geometry) only tells us that unstable modes of PPI does __exist__ but only simulation can tell us the final amplitude attained by the unstable modesand what it does to the accretion disk (i.e. does it really transport angular momentum? destroy the EQM structure or just die off ?)\n",

    "- Acceretion can't be the only thing that cause mode saturation because in different tori model where the accretion rate is different (i.e different amount of stuff is getting accretted on) the resulting state of the disk is the same (density enhancement + spiral waves) \n",
    "- Because slender torus is thinner (i.e. lower height) so it is closer to \"surface\" so that it can interact with surface waves more, so it can twist around distort the inside of the torus more. Whereas if you how a thicker torus, and same depth of bending , it twist less. (an intuitive analogy would be mixing cake batter at the same height, with more material (thicker torus) and less material(slender torus))\n",
    "- Conclusion: PP instability requires reflection on the inner boundary of the torus and this requirement (along with the requirement of constant l ) limits its applicability to specific types of tori.\n",
