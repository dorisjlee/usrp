    "- With SMR, there should be one __<Domain>__ block per level of refinement\n",
    "- <Domain> block defines BC and domain decomposition.\n",
    "- <Problem> block specifies the parameter to put in you question file (kinda like *.nml file in ramses).\n",
    "- <Output> block tells Athena what kind(s)of output you like \n",
    "     - history (hst) files dumps out the volume-averages of every cell.\n",
    "     - tabular file dump value over all zones,dont use for 3D since large file and I/O\n",
    "     - vtk,binary file need to be read by other visualization software, (low res since single point precision only)\n",
    "    - ppm:more precise 2D images at every snapshot in time.\n",
    "     - pdf : generate probability distribution function over all time \n",
    "     - should usually have a rst (restart file) dump for long runs just in case.Using the flag -r to restart\n",
    "     - problem generators usedto specify IC, BC and additional physics. \n",
    "     -for SMR you can only specify BC at root level and other higher levels that touchesthe boundary of the root level. \n",
    "     - outputting data over ghost zones (`configure --enable-ghost`).\n",

    "- Reconstruction: Getting left right states($q_R , q_L$, used to computed fluxes in Riemann solver) from cell-centered value $q_i$ using n-th order interpolation \n",
    "- Riemann solver:Compute fluxes of conserved quantities at cell interfaces (ex. x,y,z momentum flux..etc)\n",
    "- Integrator: Compute fluxes at each face (since divergence theorem, fluxes are just line integrals)\n",
    "    - non directional splitting\n",
    "    - Usually prefer CTU>VL since more accurate\n",
    "    - MUSCL-Hancock (VL) Integrator use when extremem (strong shock..etc) \n",
    "- H correction not required unless  strong planar shocks propagating parallel to grid lines forlong time\n",
    "- SMR has uniform time stepping \n",
    "      - SMR: min 4 cells at most refined level. \n",

    "- -d option can be used to create a new directory in which Athena will run and write the output files. (so don't have to renaming the output files our names and purpose .\n",
    "- what is the difference between __out__ variables M1,M2,M3 versus B1c, B2c, B3c? \n",
