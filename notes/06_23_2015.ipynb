    "- it looks like vfr and vfl is a quantity between [0,1] that sorta tells you how much volume the fluid occupy of percentage of the cell. This is determined by a series of if else cases that figures out whtether it is half, more thna half of fully in the left or right cell, so then you use this to do volume averaging . For now since I took out that whole if else I'm just going to assume that vf=1.0, so its not necessary to be in here. But for now I'm going to put vf in as a placeholder so that if I really need  to figure out the boundary cases later I could. \n"
