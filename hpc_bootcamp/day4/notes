omp_get_num_procs: get number of processors 
when you do omp parallel you need to declare which variable is private (ie. different for each thread)
#pragma omp parallel for private (x,sum) reduce(+:sum) this reduces every copy of "sum" by summing (+) it using the reduce operation.
for (i=0;i<N;i++){
 	.......
}
